1. I did not put the correct id into the getElementById() function. In working with my CSS file, I also did not put units for my font size (supposed to add
"px"), and did not write a valid font type. What was implemented correctly was
lyrics.innerHTML, which accessed the inner content of the lyrics div. I also
implemented the video.addEventListener() function correctly, which allowed me
to access the seconds of the video and display the lyrics at those appropriate
times.

2. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

3. I spent about 3 hours.
