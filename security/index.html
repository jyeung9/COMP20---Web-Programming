	<h1> Web Programming, Assignment 4: Security Testing and Writeup </h1>
	<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
	<p> I was assigned to a partner -- Sandra Alguacil -- and hired to hack into her Assignment 3 Server Side Assignment <br>
		In testing and hacking into her application, I plan to perform injection attacks and XSS attacks. In order to perform those attacks, I will assign values to the keys in the URL query strings that the client should not be able to access
		(such as database information), I will play around with how robust her code was in dealing with different data types, and I will insert alert scripts through curling as well. </p>
