1) For the longest time, I thought that I didn't need to say
312.5 "px" because the implementation for 0 pixels did not
require a "px" tagged onto the end of it. Other than that, I
learned that the correct implementation of media screens
does not involve wrapping it around a rule (ex: body{}).
Other correct implementations include the "dot" operation
involving classes (.homer), the correct url, setting the
ranges for the media screen correctly (with cascading rules in mind) and just being familiar with how the coordinates
work.
2) I did not collaborate with anyone.
3) I spent about 2 hours on this assignment.
