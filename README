1. The purpose of this Git repository is to store all the work that I had created
in this web programming course. Collectively, the contents of this repository
make up a portfolio which allows me to share work I've done with employers,
and just others who need a reference, or am curious what I have done. 

2. My favorite assignment was the second one. While it was difficult in that
I had never done this before, I really appreciated that it pushed me outside
of my comfort zone. Furthermore, before that assignment, I had not heard 
about API's. As such, from this assignment, I thought using the Google Maps API
was really entertaining and cool.

3. I think I have grown a lot since day 1! From real-world tools, to
understanding how things work under the hood, I really appreciate the fact that
we are continuously getting exposed to things that don't just apply to within
the class, but very much to the future and beyond. 

4. The most important thing I learned in this course was getting into the
habit of using GitHub. There were some times where the code I was working with
was broken, or I was not sure as to why my code did not work. It was much 
easier to just download the files/code from GitHub (which had my last
working version) than to debug the flawed code for hours on end. Furthermore,
Github was useful in allowing my team members and I to access content that
each of us had pushed for the semester project.

5. Now that I have finished the course, I would like to delve deeper into other
dynamic frameworks, such as React, in order to implement features for animations
and to make my products more exciting.
