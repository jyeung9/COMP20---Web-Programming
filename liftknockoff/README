1. Some things that were implemented correctly:
- parsing the json response text
- displaying the marker for closest vehicle, weinermobile on marker click
- displaying the markers for the vehicle, passenger, weinermobile
- displaying more than one weinermobile, and displaying each one's distance 
correctly
- displaying the vehicle markers correctly, with their usernames and their 
distance from me
- displaying the me marker's distance from the closest vehicle correctly, 
along with username and closest weinermobile
- displaying the passenger markers, their usernames, and their distances from
me

Some things that were not implemented correctly (but I fixed): 
- I copy/pasted the code over from when I was a passenger; I had an error 
where the "weiner" and "passenger" objects weren't recognized. That was because
I had not changed some of the array and indice names.
- upon clicking the me marker: 
the distance from closest passenger is a weinermobile when there are no
available passengers -- not sure if it will compute distance when there
are actually passengers
- accessing the elements inside the vehicle/passenger array -- keeps saying 
"passenger" is undefined but I had same implementation for "vehicles"


2. Acknowledgments: I talked with TA's Julianna, Kingsley, and Min, 
who all helped me tremendously. I also credit StackOverflow for the Haversine
formula code.

3. I spent over 20 hours on this assignment (I lost count)
